Return a new list consisting of only the elements of the list that return True with the function (in the same order).\n",

    "***Exercise 3:*** Make a `Queue` class.  A queue is a data structure where you have two main methods: `push()` and `pop()`.  Items are added to the queue with `push()` and returned one at a time in the same order with `pop()`.  Once an item has been popped from a queue it will never be returned again.  We also want to be able to iterate through our queue.  If we completely loop through it, we will deplete it so that it is empty again.\n",
